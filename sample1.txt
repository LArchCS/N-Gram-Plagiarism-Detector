While getting the right answer is important, we are also interested in how well thought out your solution is; are there easier, or faster ways? Is the code understandable to another engineer picking it up? If there are obvious ways it could be abstracted or extended, is it designed to support that?  For example, this N-tuple detection algorithm may end up being used in other contexts (like a website) and so should be easy to reuse.
